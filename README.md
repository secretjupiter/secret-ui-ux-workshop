# Secret Developer Workshop: Delivering good UI/UX for users

Learn building shiny frontends for dApps using Secret's private smart contracts - standing out guaranteed! Open to developers of all levels.

## üí° What you‚Äôll learn

With Secret Network‚Äôs private smart contracts, you can build apps with encrypted input, output, and state that are still auditable. This protects users and opens up new use cases like private NFTs, B2B invoicing, private on-chain voting, decentralized certification platforms, and more.

Superior technologies can get forgotten fast in the market if they aren‚Äôt easy and fun. Therefore it is crucial to deliver a welcoming frontend for dApps, so that people from all backgrounds can utilize these things fast. Also, who doesn‚Äôt like shiny cutting-edge website designs, right?

So let‚Äôs build, discuss, and enhance a great user experience with Secret Network so that you can build better dApps!

## üßë‚Äçüíª The workshop will go as follows:

**(1h)** You‚Äôll get an introduction to Secret Network and the initial problems, which we will tackle together

**(30m)** We‚Äôll walk you through the first part of the application codebase

**(1h)** You‚Äôll have multiple 15 to 30-minute break room sessions in small groups to discuss, write and enhance the frontend. You will also learn how to interact with the Secret SDK secret.js

**(30m)** We‚Äôll summarize the experience and pinpoint all aspects to consider while building a frontend. We will also use the created dApp UI to interact with a SNIP-20 smart contract in the pulsar-2 Secret testnet.

**(30m)** You‚Äôll get to use and test the private dApp UI you just built!

**(1h)** Networking & drinks in the bar across the street

After the workshop ends, we‚Äôll stick around to talk about Secret UI/UX development in general and answer any questions you might have.

## ‚ùóÔ∏èSetup

1. Install Node.js LTS including NPM and yarn if you want to do local development. You can also use our Stackblitz.

2. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/overview-ecosystem-and-technology/secret-network-overview/testnet) to set up your Keplr wallet, add the Secret Network testnet, and fund your testnet wallet with tokens.

3. We will hook you up with the git repository during the workshop.

4. If you‚Äôve never worked with Secret Network smart contracts and/or Secret.js before, you might find it helpful to complete our [Secret.Js tutorial](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/getting-started/interacting-with-the-testnet) prior to attending the workshop.
